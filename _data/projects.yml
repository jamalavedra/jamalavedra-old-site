    CS Master thesis
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This thesis proposes an application of convolutional feature points as smart virtual sensors. The feature descriptors are formed using the feature maps of one of the layers of a VGG-16 network pre-trained on Imagenet.From the extracted and matched features, information is obtained from each of them to create a data-set that describes the sequence of frames under consideration.

    During my bachelor thesis, I developed a computer vision-based system in which, throgugh a camera attached to a mobile robot that focuses on the roof, the system is able to describe the movememnt and relative poisition of the device.
